
In Phase(i), I have chosen synchronized statements to protect the critical sections of the methods deposit(), withdraw(), and query(). 
Synchronized statements are used to ensure that only one thread can execute the synchronized block of code at a time for a given object.

The choice of using synchronized statements over synchronized methods is based on the need for more specific control over synchronization.

Synchronized statements allow us to synchronize specific parts of code rather than the entire methods. 
One significant difference between synchronized method and block is that Synchronized block generally reduce scope of lock. 

This is beneficial in scenarios where only certain parts of a method need to be synchronized, while other parts can execute concurrently without synchronization overhead.

Also, when only a small amount of the code needs to be synchronized, synchronized statements perform better than synchronized methods. 
This is because methods that are synchronized use the entire method, which could give needless conflicts between threads if the function as a whole doesn't need synchronization, which in the end makes it slower.





Phase(ii)

When comparing the execution times of the two-thread and three-thread implementations, the three-thread implementation runs faster:

Concurrency: More threads are available to handle requests concurrently when there are three threads. This implies that other threads can go on processing requests while one thread waits for a synchronisation lock. Concurrent execution has the potential to accelerate processing times overall.
